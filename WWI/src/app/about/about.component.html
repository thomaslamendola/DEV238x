  <h2>Tons of products, one click away!</h2>
  <p>Here you will find the best products at the best prices!</p>

  <p>It is very hard to find the words here... it feels like I didn't have enough time to polish the final result here.</p>
  <p>If I had more time I would have worked at unifying the style a lot more, using more angular material "properly".</p>
  <p>Having said that, I am very proud of the final result considering I am still relatively new to Frontend Development as well as Angular framework itself.</p>
  <p>I noticed that studying hard was pivotal, however I can see how much more effective and important is practice.</p>
  <p>Thankful to have had a chance to do so with this exam!</p>
